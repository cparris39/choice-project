  <p class="food">Players are given points based on performance statistics from their real life games. For example, a
    wide receiver would score points based on his statistics for yards, touchdowns, and even fumbles. Most fantasy
    leagues involve playing against another opponent's team each week to see which person can score the most points
    among their starting lineup.</p>
